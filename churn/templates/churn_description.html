    <p>Unsatisfied clients might express their will to leave a specific company (<strong>BRAND</strong>).
    This is what we call churn. We are listing here a list of basic example so you can understand it.</p>
<div class="card card--dark card--notification">
{#  <p class="card__text">Global roaming is now switched on</p>#}
 <table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th align="left">No</th>
    <th align="left">Source</th>
    <th align="left">Text</th>
    <th align="left">Label</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>BRAND-1</td>
    <td>I am leaving &lt<strong>BRAND-1</strong>&gt at the end of the month!</td>
    <td> <span class="font--semi-bold int-red">Churn</span> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>BRAND-1</td>
    <td>I am fed up with &lt<strong>BRAND-1</strong>&gt! I’m switching to &lt<strong>BRAND-2</strong>&gt.</td>
    <td> <span class="font--semi-bold int-red">Churn</span> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>BRAND-2</td>
    <td>I am fed up with &lt<strong>BRAND-1</strong>&gt! I’m switching to &lt<strong>BRAND-2</strong>&gt.</td>
    <td> <span class="font--semi-bold int-green">No churn</span> </td>
  </tr>

   <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>BRAND-1</td>
    <td>I am fed up with &lt<strong>BRAND-1</strong>&gt!</td>
    <td> <span class="font--semi-bold int-green">No churn</span> </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p><br>Note that for number 2 and 3, the text is the same. However th reference brand change.
Indeed <strong>BRAND-2</strong> is not considered by the churny content since the user wants to join its service .
For example 4 it is not churn as well. Expressing disagreement with a service does not necessary mean you will quit it. </p>

<p> With the bot you can try yourself to enter text with either churny or non churny content. The aim of the bot
will be to detect if the entry is churny or not. Please help us to improve bot performance by giving it feedback on its answers. </p>
