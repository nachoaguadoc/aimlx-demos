    <p>Unsatisfied clients might express their will to leave a specific company (<strong>BRAND</strong>).
    This is what we call churn. We are listing here a list of basic examples so you can understand it.</p>
<div class="card card--dark card--notification">
{#  <p class="card__text">Global roaming is now switched on</p>#}
 <table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th align="left">No</th>
    <th align="left">Source</th>
    <th align="left">Text</th>
    <th align="left">Label</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>BRAND-1</td>
    <td>I am leaving &lt<strong>BRAND-1</strong>&gt at the end of the month!</td>
    <td> <span class="font--semi-bold int-red">Churn</span> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>BRAND-1</td>
    <td>I am fed up with &lt<strong>BRAND-1</strong>&gt! I’m switching to &lt<strong>BRAND-2</strong>&gt.</td>
    <td> <span class="font--semi-bold int-red">Churn</span> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>BRAND-2</td>
    <td>I am fed up with &lt<strong>BRAND-1</strong>&gt! I’m switching to &lt<strong>BRAND-2</strong>&gt.</td>
    <td> <span class="font--semi-bold int-green">No churn</span> </td>
  </tr>

   <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>BRAND-1</td>
    <td>I don't like &lt<strong>BRAND-1</strong>&gt!</td>
    <td> <span class="font--semi-bold int-green">No churn</span> </td>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>I will leave your service at the end of the month!</td>
    <td> <span class="font--semi-bold int-red">Churn</span> </td>
  </tr>

</div>

<p><br>1. It is churn since the user is clear about his will to leave <strong>BRAND-1</strong>.</p>

<p>2-3. The text is the same for both examples, however the reference brand is different.
In this case, <strong>BRAND-2</strong> is not considered by the churny content since the user wants to join its service.
</p>

<p>4. It is not churn as well since expressing disagreement with a service does not necessary mean you will quit it. </p>

<p>5. Here we don't have source brand. The user directly says he wants to leave the service.</p>

<p> With the bot, you can try yourself to enter text with either churny or non churny content. The aim of the bot
will be to detect if the entry is churny or not. Please help us to improve the bot performance by giving it feedback on its answers. </p>
